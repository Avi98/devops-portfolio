| Static sites are blazing fast, require no server maintenance, and are easy to deploy. They are perfect for marketing sites, professional services, and general informational websites. Static sites are built for preformance and search engine indexability  | SSR enables dynamic content based on user interactions. Primarily for clients with ecommerce packages or community based applications with dynamic user data.     | The difference between a website and a web app is that a web app is interactive. It allows you to do things like create an account, log in, and interact with other users. A web app is a website that has a backend. |
